## [0.4.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Investigations workspace foundation: SQLite store, GUI dashboard, hash-chained audit log, and JSON/Markdown exports.
- Probe evidence capture for username checks.
- WMN cache hardening with corrupt-cache fallback and atomic update writes.
- `recce username --list-categories`.
- Bounded batch concurrency controls.
- Expanded `recce doctor` diagnostics.

### Changed

- Licence is now AGPL-3.0-or-later from v0.4.0 onwards.
- SPDX licence headers added across the Python codebase.

### BREAKING

- `recce email --deep` now requires the `--i-own-these-emails` consent flag. Running deep mode without it prints a consent-focused error and points to the usage docs.
